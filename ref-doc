API Gateway -
    -   Rest API section.
    -   Create API
    -   Name API, set method, response.
    -   Deploy
    -   Test deployed API

Services -
APP -   S3 (Simple Storage service) : Simple file storage, can be config to access the static files
API Gateway -   REST API : API Gateway (requests, methods, responses)
Functions - AWS lambda : Hold all the business logic, execute code on demand
Data -  DynamoDB (WIP) : Store, and retrieve data
Authentication -  Cognito : Authenticate users
Authorization (WIP) - IAM
DNS -   Route 53 : Translate URL  (free SSL)
Caching - CloudFront (WIP), AWS Redis : Improve performance by caching the static files at diff locations
Logging - CloudeWatch

API Gateway
    -   Define API Endpoints & HTTP Methods, Authorize access
    -   Triger an action, or trigger an AWS lambda func, directly acces some AWS service
    -   Resource, Method, CORS, Proxy, Method Request, Response.
    -   Body Mappping Templates (vimp) - use to map request/response data

AWS lambda
    -   Service which allow to host code on it (processing and forward)
    -   Eg. Request(upload photo) -> AWS Lambda (Pocess using ML) -> Store in S3
    -   Usecases -> s3(file gets upload), CloudWatch (scheduled - CRON job)
    -   Suported lang -> Python, Node JS, C#, Java, Go
    -   Can interact with other AWS service, and pass on the response
    -   If we set lambda proxy, we pass complete reqquest object to lambda func, it also by passes the Integration response.

CloudeWatch
    -   Store logs, can acces log in `log groups`

DynamoDB - NoSQL DB provided by AWS, no server needed (no provisioning)
    Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability.
    DynamoDB lets you offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling a distributed database 
    so that you don't have to worry about hardware provisioning, setup and configuration, replication, software patching, or cluster scaling
    Concepts :
        - Partition Key (unique key to uniquely identify the document), Primary key
        - Attributes
        - Primary Key => Partition Key or Partition Key + Sort Key
        - Global secondary Index - Manages selected attributes in special way (makes query fast, efficient)
        - Local Secondary Index - Partion key + Attribute (brings lot of flexibility)
    - Basic Functionality - Works as Repository and Event Functions to trigger lambda.
    - Can set TTL atrribute to remove entry at mentioned time(epoch format)
    - aws-sdk is provided as default in every lambda function
